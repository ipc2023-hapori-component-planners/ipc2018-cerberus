    ## The "%post"-part of this script is called after the container has
    ## been created with the "%setup"-part above and runs "inside the
    ## container". Most importantly, it is used to install dependencies
    ## and build the planner. Add all commands that have to be executed
    ## once before the planner runs in this part of the script.

    ## Install all necessary dependencies.
    apt-get update
    apt-get -y install cmake g++ g++-multilib make python

    ## Build your planner
    cd /planner
    ./build.py release64

    ## Strip binaries.
    strip --strip-all /planner/builds/release64/bin/preprocess
    strip --strip-all /planner/builds/release64/bin/downward

    ## Remove packages unneeded for running the planner.
    apt -y autoremove cmake g++ g++-multilib make
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    ## Only keep essential binaries.
    mkdir -p /compiled-planner/builds/release64
    mv /planner/driver /planner/fast-downward.py /planner/plan.py /compiled-planner
    mv /planner/builds/release64/bin /compiled-planner/builds/release64
    rm -rf /planner
    mv /compiled-planner /planner
